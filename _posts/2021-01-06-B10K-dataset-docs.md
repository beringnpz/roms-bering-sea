Numerous Bering 10K ROMS model simulations have been run to date, including hindcasts of the past few decades, long-term forecasts under CMIP5 and CMIP6 emissions scenarios, and seasonal retropective forecasts.  Data and metadata related to these simulations are held in a number of locations.  This page serves as a centralized hub for this data and metadata.

## The model

Model source code is available on GitHub: [beringnpz/roms-bering-sea](https://github.com/beringnpz/roms-bering-sea)

## The documentation

A few guides for working with the Bering10K output dataset:

- [`Bering10K_readme.pdf`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uG4IF5deEmIvAxEGNYjTRh9p6Y8IB5v7/view?usp=sharing): Provides an overview of the simulation variants, including different base model versions, parent model forcing datasets, and biological modules.
- [`Bering10K_ROMS_coordinates.pdf`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WZTrnG9WXQwM4zXO6n9G345P5eRpkSUW/view?usp=sharing): A tutorial on working with the curvilinear, sigma-coordinate ROMS spatial grid, aimed at those whos will be working data on the native grid.
- [`Bering10K_simulation_variables.xlsx`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C1FCxRMBm0uBv2wEKwrGfHmLnjt_gFvG/view?usp=sharing): A list of all simulations and the archived output variables associated with each, updated periodically as new simulations are run or new variables are made available.

Please also see the [Literature page](../_pages/literature.md) for a list scientific publications related to the model, including model description and skill assessment.

## The output data

Most output data is stored on the University of Washington hyak-mox computer cluster, and is accessible to collaborators only.  If interested in beginning a collaboration, please [contact](mailto:kelly.kearney@noaa.gov) the Bering10K team.

The following simulations are available for public download via [the PMEL ERDDAP server ](add/link/when/live):
