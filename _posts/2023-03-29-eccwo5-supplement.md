## Nutrient and phytoplankton concentration

4-day mean values (in 2000, an average sea-ice year) along the 40-m and 70-m isobaths and selected cross-shelf transects.  Nutrient values on the shelf are controlled by feedbacks within the biogeochemistry more than by the initial or boundary conditions, leading to the large differences seen between models.
