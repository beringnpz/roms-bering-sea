## ROMS: Bering Sea domain

This repository holds the source code for the Bering Sea ROMS domain, including biological code for the BESTNPZ and FEAST models.  The code originated in 2009 as a clone of Kate Hedstrom's branch.  This repository was initiated on 08/17/15 in an attempt to bring several slightly different versions of the code together into one cohesive set.

The ROMS folder holds the main source code.  The Projects folder holds all setup files (makefiles, input, build scripts, etc.).
