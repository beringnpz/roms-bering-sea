## ROMS: Bering Sea domain

This repository holds the source code for the Bering Sea ROMS domain, including biological code for the BESTNPZ and FEAST models.  The code originated in 2009 as a clone of Kate Hedstrom's branch.  This repository was initiated on 08/17/15 in an attempt to bring several slightly different versions of the code together into one cohesive set.
