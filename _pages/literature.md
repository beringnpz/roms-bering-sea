This following academic publications describe the configuration and performance of the Bering10K ROMS model and its associated biological modules.

#### Danielson et al., 2011

The Bering Sea ROMS model was derived from the larger Northeast Pacific (NEP5) ROMS model. Much of the preliminary parameter configuration and validation of that model, including sea ice and tidal dynamics, are equally applicable to the Bering Sea sub-domain, and are documented here.

#### Gibson & Spitz, 2011

This paper introduces the BESTNPZ biological model. The biological module is tested in a one-dimensional environment representative of the M2 mooring location, and a sensitivity analysis looks at the relationships between output variables and input parameters.

#### Hermann et al., 2013

The first paper detailing the Bering10K model in full, this includes a description of the ocean, sea ice, and biogeochemistry circa 2013; model validation focusing on tides, sea ice, circulation, and mixed layer dynamics); and a statistical analysis of covariability between output variables in a single long-term forecast (circa CMIP3).

#### Hermann et al., 2016

This paper describes a series of long-term forecast simulations that downscale three CMIP3 (AR4) global circulation models under the A1B emissions scenario.

#### Ortiz et al., 2016

This paper describes the results of a hindcast simulation with the Bering10K and BESTNPZ models fully coupled to a spatially-explicit fisheries ecosystem model known as FEAST.

#### Kearney et al., 2020

This paper describes an updated version of the BESTNPZ model, along with biophysical validation of the updated model (focusing on sea ice timing and extent, cold pool dynamics, macro- and micro-nutrient limitation, and primary production). It also includes a brief history of the changes that have been implemented in the biogeochemical, ocean, and sea ice portions of the model between the Hermann et al, 2013, Hermann et al., 2016, and Kearney et al., 2020 versions of the Bering10K-BESTNPZ model.

#### Kearney 2021

Many end users of the Bering10K model focus on its ability to simulate bottom temperature on the eastern Bering Sea shelf, and how the hindcast simulation compares to data collected annually across the shelf in support of fisheries management.  This report provides a deep dive into the metrics use to compare these two datasets, with a focus on surface and bottom temperature.

##### Kearney et al., 2021

This paper tests the seasonal-to-sub-seasonal forecast capabilities of the Bering10K model with respect to seasonal sea ice cover and bottom temperature.  These findings support the persistence forecast product that is presented each spring.
