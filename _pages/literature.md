### The Bering10K physical model
    
For a detailed description of the Bering Sea ROMS model, please see the following publications:

- Hermann AJ, Gibson GA, Bond NA, Curchitser EN, Hedstrom K, Cheng W, Wang M, Stabeno PJ, Eisner L, Cieciel KD (2013) A multivariate analysis of observed and modeled biophysical variability on the Bering Sea shelf: Multidecadal hindcasts (1970-2009) and forecasts (2010-2040). Deep Res Part II Top Stud Oceanogr 94:121–139
- Hermann AJ, Curchitser EN, Hedstrom K, Cheng W, Bond NA, Wang M, Aydin K, Stabeno PJ, Cokelet ED, Gibson GA (2016) Projected future biophysical states of the Bering Sea. Deep Sea Res Part II Top Stud Oceanogr 134:30–47

### The Northeast Pacific (NEP) model

The Bering Sea ROMS model was derived from the larger Northeast Pacific (NEP5) ROMS model. Much of the preliminary validation of that model, including sea ice and tidal dynamics, are equally applicable to the Bering Sea sub-domain, and are documented in:

- Danielson S, Curchitser E, Hedstrom K, Weingartner T, Stabeno P (2011) On ocean and sea ice modes of variability in the Bering Sea. J Geophys Res Ocean 116:1–24

### Biological modules

The lower trophic level BESTNPZ model is described here:

- Kearney KA, Hermann A, Cheng W, Ortiz I, Aydin K (in prep) A coupled pelagic-benthic-sympagic biogeochemical model for the Bering Sea: documentation and validation of the BESTNPZ model within a high-resolution regional ocean model.
