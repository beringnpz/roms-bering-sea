The Bering10K ROMS model is an implementation of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) for the Bering Sea.  Details of this model can be found alongside the [GitHub code repository](https://github.com/beringnpz/roms-bering-sea) as well as in the articles listed on the Literature page.

This website provides information related to but not included within the code respository itself.  This includes some additional documentation as well as supplementary material for Bering10K publications.
